# UniTest: AI-Based Question Paper Generator

UniTest is an intelligent question paper generator that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to generate syllabus-aligned, Bloom’s Taxonomy-based questions for academic assessments. Designed to assist educators, it ensures curriculum relevance, question diversity, and cognitive balance.

## Features

- Syllabus-Aligned Questions: Generates questions directly from provided syllabus topics.
- Bloom’s Taxonomy Integration: Classifies questions based on cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).
- AI-Powered Question Generation: Uses NLP models to generate meaningful and accurate questions.
- Question Paper Blueprint: Visual representation of question distribution by difficulty and topic.
- Topic-Based Filtering: Select specific units or chapters to tailor question papers.
- Export Option: Download generated question papers in PDF format.
- User-Friendly Interface: Clean, intuitive frontend for educators and admins.

## Why UniTest?

Traditional question paper setting is time-consuming, prone to repetition, and often lacks variety in cognitive levels. UniTest solves these problems by:

- Automating question generation
- Ensuring better syllabus coverage
- Enhancing learning outcomes through balanced cognitive level distribution

## How It Works

1. Input Syllabus: User provides the unit/topic syllabus.
2. Keyword Extraction: NLP extracts key concepts from input.
3. Question Generation: AI model generates questions using pre-trained language models.
4. Classification: Each question is mapped to a Bloom’s Taxonomy level.
5. Display: Questions are shown with options to edit, shuffle, and export.
